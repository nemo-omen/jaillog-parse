[**unified**][unified] processor to use browser APIs to parse and compile HTML.

*   Interface by [**unified**][unified]
*   [**hast**][hast] syntax tree
*   Parses HTML to the tree with [**rehype-dom-parse**][parse]
*   [Plug-ins][plugins] transform the tree
*   Compiles the tree to HTML using [**rehype-dom-stringify**][stringify]

If you don’t care about bundle size, or if you don’t trust content, or if you’re
not in a (modern) browser environment, use [`rehype`][rehype] instead.

If you’re not concerned with bundle size or are in an environment in which you
don’t trust (or don’t have) the native DOM API, you may prefer to use
[`rehype`][rehype] instead.

As `rehype-dom` is designed for browser use, it defaults to parsing in
**fragment mode**, whereas [`rehype`][rehype] defaults to **document mode**!

Don’t need the parser?
Or the compiler?
[That’s OK][unified-usage].

## Install

This package is [ESM only](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c):
Node 12+ is needed to use it and it must be `import`ed instead of `require`d.

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install rehype-dom
```

This package exports the following identifier: `rehypeDom`.
There is no default export.

## Use

```js
import {rehypeDom} from 'rehype-dom'

rehypeDom()
  .process('<p>text, <b>hyper')
  .then((file) => {
    console.log(String(file))
  })
```

Yields:

```html
<p>text, <b>hyper</b></p>
```

Configuration for [**rehype-dom-parse**][parse] and
[**rehype-dom-stringify**][stringify] can be set with
`.data('settings', {/*...*/})`.

## Security

Use of `rehype-dom` can open you up to a [cross-site scripting (XSS)][xss]
attack if the document is unsafe or unsafe plugins are used.
Use [`rehype-sanitize`][sanitize] to make the tree safe.
